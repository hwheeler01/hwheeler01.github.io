### Postdoctoral Research Associate

#### Background
The Department of Biology at Loyola University Chicago invites applications for a full-time postdoctoral associate, with expertise in the areas of population genetics, statistical genomics, and computational biology. The position is for one year with the possibility of renewal for additional years based on performance.
This position will support NIH-funded research on the development of statistical models that integrate similarity in genetic, transcriptomic, or other omics-level data for human complex trait prediction within and between populations in the laboratory of Dr. Heather Wheeler. The [Wheeler Lab](http://hewlab.org/) includes an active program in graduate and undergraduate instruction; as such, this position will include numerous occasions to engage in student mentoring and if interested, teaching.

#### Duties and Responsibilities 
The postdoc will work with Dr. Wheeler to investigate the degree of transferability of genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association results across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations. The successful candidate will be involved in omics data analysis, statistical modeling, software development, writing manuscripts, giving presentations, and mentoring students. 

#### Minimum Qualifications 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, biostatistics, or a related field with a solid publication record. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical, statistical, quantitative, and computational (e.g. R, Python, Linux) skills and should be comfortable with large data sets (e.g. GWAS, RNA-Seq), distributed computing, and databases. High performance computing and cloud computing experience is a plus.

#### Instructions to Applicants
Applicants should submit a Cover Letter describing their research interests and availability, current Curriculum Vitae, and contact information for two references to [hwheeler1@luc.edu](mailto:hwheeler1@luc.edu).
