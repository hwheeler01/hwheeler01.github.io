She was awarded the 2018 <a href="https://www.luc.edu/cas/thesujackawards/2018sujackawards/">Sujack Family Award for Faculty Research Excellence</a>. Before joining Loyola in 2015, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="http://medicine.uchicago.edu/">The University of Chicago</a>. Heather holds a PhD in Genetics from <a href="http://genetics.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> and a BA in Biology from <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/cla/biology/">Hamline University</a>. When not working on modeling complex trait genetics or course design, Heather enjoys exploring Chicago with her family. Favorite spots include <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/">The Field Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.momotarochicago.com/">Momotaro</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Coliseum-Park/">Coliseum Park</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field">Comiskey or whatever it's called</a> (especially when the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/twins/?c_id=min">Twins</a> are in town), and <a href="http://www.lh-st.com/">Lincoln Hall</a>.

<figcaption>
Paul is a thesis-track master's student in the <a href="https://luc.edu/bioinformatics/msinbioinformatics/">MS Bioinformatics</a> program.
He studied Cell Biology and Genetics as an undergraduate at the University of Lagos where he developed a strong passion for human, population and statistical genetics.
His interest lies in genome sequence data analysis. After the MS, he plans to continue on to a PhD in Computational Biology, and in the long term, he would love to take up a
research position in a biotech company or startup. In his free time, he likes to either watch European football (soccer) games, hangout with friends, cook, see a movie, listen to music, and/or sleep.

<figcaption>
Peter is a senior Biochemistry and Biology major in the Interdisciplinary Honors Program.  He is also a <a href="http://www.luc.edu/sustainability/research/studentfellowships/carbon_fellowships/index.shtml">Carbon Fellow</a> and <a href="http://www.luc.edu/cas/academics_mulcahyscholarship.shtml">Mulcahy Scholar</a>. After college, he plans to continue his academic career in graduate school. His love of genetics and molecular biology stems from dinner table conversations with his parents about medicine and the background behind diseases.  As he has grown older, he has developed a passion for human genetics because of the seemingly endless mysteries that the human genome holds.  In his free time, he can be found cheering for his local Buffalo sports teams, eating chicken wings, or drinking from his Linus Pauling coffee mug.
