She teaches courses within the <a href="http://luc.edu/bioinformatics/">Bioinformatics</a> major. She was recently featured in a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/wheeler-newsletterpage-2016.pdf">New Faculty Spotlight</a> article in the Biology Department Newsletter. Before joining Loyola in 2015, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="http://medicine.uchicago.edu/index.aspx">The University of Chicago</a>. While there, she appeared in a <a href="http://www.labtv.com/Home/Profile?researcherId=1894">LabTV video</a> describing her research. Heather holds a Ph.D. in Genetics from <a href="http://genetics.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> and a B.A. in Biology from <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/cla/biology/">Hamline University</a>. When not working on modeling complex trait genetics or course design, Heather enjoys exploring Chicago with her family. Favorite spots include <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/">The Field Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.momotarochicago.com/">Momotaro</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Coliseum-Park/">Coliseum Park</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Field">The Cell</a>, and <a href="http://www.lh-st.com/">Lincoln Hall</a>.

<figcaption>
	Angela is a sophomore Molecular Biology major with a minor in Biostatistics, with current plans to move into industrial biological research, possibly pursuing graduate school. She joined the Wheeler lab fall of 2016 after attending the computer science section of the First Year Research Experience that summer. Outside of lab, she enjoys seeing musicals, including winning the Book of Mormon lottery this summer, and attending concerts, once driving four hours to Warped Tour to crowd surf at Neck Deep.

<figcaption>
        Alexa is a senior majoring in Bioinformatics with plans to pursue a graduate degree in Genetic Counseling. Having a deep personal love for the arts, she grew up in the theater, and has even performed at Loyola. Viewing science as an additional creative outlet, her two very different passions have aligned. She hopes to remain at the forefront of genetic medicine, and eventually work with families. When not geeking-out about science, or singing loudly and probably annoying her neighbors, she enjoys exploring the city with her sister. <a href="https://www.taskstream.com/ts/badalamenti1/AlexaBadalamenti">ePortfolio</a>
