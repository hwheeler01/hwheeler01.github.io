        Alexa is a junior majoring in Bioinformatics with plans to pursue a graduate degree in Genetic Counseling. Having a deep personal love for the arts, she grew up in the theater, and has even performed at Loyola. Viewing science as an additional creative outlet, her two very different passions have aligned. She hopes to remain at the forefront of genetic medicine, and eventually work with families. When not geeking-out about science, or singing loudly and probably annoying her neighbors, she enjoys exploring the city with her sister. <a href="https://www.taskstream.com/ts/badalamenti1/AlexaBadalamenti">ePortfolio</a>
