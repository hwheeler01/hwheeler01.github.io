<figcaption>
Angela is a thesis-track master's student in the accelerated <a href="http://luc.edu/bioinformatics/accelerateddegrees/">BS Biology/MS Bioinformatics</a> program with her project on "The Genetic Architecture of Lipid Traits in Diverse Populations." Her interests include genetic diversity within and between human populations. She is a 2017-2019 <a href="http://www.luc.edu/sustainability/research/studentfellowships/carbon_fellowships/index.shtml">Carbon Fellow</a> and won Loyola's Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award in 2018, and she has current plans to move into industrial biological research after completion of her degrees. She joined the Wheeler Lab fall of 2016 after attending the bioinformatics/computer science section of the First Year Research Experience that summer. Outside of lab, she enjoys seeing musicals, including winning the Hamilton lottery, and attending concerts, once driving four hours to Warped Tour to crowd surf at Neck Deep.

He studied Cell Biology and Genetics as an undergraduate at the University of Lagos where he developed a strong passion for human, population and statistical genetics.
His interest lies in genome sequence data analysis. After the MS, he plans to continue on to a PhD in Computational Biology, and in the long term, he would love to take up a
research position in a biotech company or startup. In his free time, he likes to either watch European football (soccer) games, hangout with friends, cook, see a movie, listen to music, and/or sleep.

After college, he plans to continue his academic career in graduate school. His love of genetics and molecular biology stems from dinner table conversations with his parents about medicine and the background behind diseases.  As he has grown older, he has developed a passion for human genetics because of the seemingly endless mysteries that the human genome holds.  In his free time, he can be found cheering for his local Buffalo sports teams, eating chicken wings, or drinking from his Linus Pauling coffee mug.
